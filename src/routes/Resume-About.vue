    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p class="brief">
      My name is Jake Hamilton. For the last 5 years I have been honing both
      my Theater Tech and Web Development skills. While this may seem like
      a strange combination, it turns out they are quite a bit alike.

      During my time in the theater (just over 5 years now), I have picked up
      a love for sound design. To me, there is just something magical about
      crafting just the perfect sound for my audience to experience. Through all
      my years as a sound lead at Laguna Hills High School and Creative
      Kids Playhouse, I've produced all my own sound effects. Many from scratch.

    <p class="brief">
      Still, an equally exciting moment is the thrill of mixing live in the
      theater. Expertly dialing in each and every sound to fit the moment is
      quite possibly the greatest joy that I've ever experienced. There is this
      moment when you get everything sounding just right and it is magical.
      Listening to the masterpiece that you've just created along with the
      audience brings an amazing sense of satisfaction.

      On the Web Development side of things, I've fallen in love with JavaScript.
      After self-studying for 5 years, I've learned how to learn. Being able to
      pick up new technologies quickly is more important than ever right now. I'm
      proud to say that I've gotten good at doing just that. I love every moment
      when I'm working on an app, even the frustrating parts. In fact, I enjoy
      the hardest parts the most because of the teaching they do. When I struggle
      to do something that I've never attempted before, I'm normally excited because
      it means that I get to learn some whole new concept.

      Recently I've taken a liking to Vue and its family of Vuex, Vue Router.
      These libraries take everything I love about JavaScript and make them
      better. Coupled with Node, you have my absolute favorite stack. JavaScript
      is my bread and butter, so Vue + Node + MongoDB is definitely speaking
      my language. I love real-time data with socket.io too!
